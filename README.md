# Bounce-Rate-Analysis

This project analyze the bounce rate of website, which is the percentage of visitors who leave the website after viewing only one page without taking any further actions.

##Insight
1.The overall bounce rate was a high 65.47%—2 out of 3 users left without interacting further.

2.There’s a strong negative correlation (-0.65) between bounce rate and session duration. In short, the longer a user stays, the less likely they are to bounce.

3.16.6% of users were highly engaged, while 44% bounced quickly. This gap presents a major opportunity for improvement!
